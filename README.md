# Weather App

### I made this app following a course on Node.js from Udemy. I will continue to add features and exploring what more I can do to make this app even better.

How to install and use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t0nyandre/weather-app-node.git

npm install

node app.js -a '1600 Amphitheater Parkway'
```

Replace the address after "-a" to check the temperature at your own location.
